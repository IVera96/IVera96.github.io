I’m a curious and cheerful soul who loves discovering stories hidden in data.

With a background in Applied Mathematics and a passion that bridges **Data Analysis** and **Data Science**, I enjoy turning complex information into clear, visual, and impactful insights. Whether it’s through Python code, a colorful dashboard, or a good conversation, I love making sense of things and sharing what I learn along the way.

## 📚 My personal “data bookshelf”

> Some of the things that shaped me, inspired me, or simply made me go *wow*:

- “The Art of Statistics” – for data that speaks clearly  
- Logic puzzles & math games – for joy and mental gym  
- Dashboards that tell a story – because design *matters*  
- Multilingual conversations – where code and culture meet  
- Cooking with intuition – because recipes are just another kind of algorithm 👩‍🍳

## ☀️ One last thing

Before being a data analyst, I’m a human being — warm, curious, and always learning.  
If my work reflects a bit of that spark, then I’m on the right track 💫
